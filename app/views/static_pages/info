					Asher is a collection of women’s clothing born out of a deep-seeded love for extraordinary fashion. As the brand grew, we were moved to serve greater purpose with our products. We found that purpose in Asher Babies, a partnership that faces the reality of childhood abandonment in Africa.

					On average, hundreds of babies are abandoned by their mothers each month in African hospitals, clinics, police stations and even outdoors. 
					Proceeds from every Asher purchase help provide a loving home, basic needs, healthcare and educational fees for African children who have been abandoned. Each garment from the Asher Collection is paired with a specific child to fund his or her specialized needs.
